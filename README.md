# RandomNumberGame2025Landis

1. Do imports,
2. Test that I can function as a C programmer by running a Hello World.
3. Prompt user for their name,
4. Greet user
5. Generate random number between 1 and 100
6. Prompt user to guess the number
7. Inform user that they were either too high, too low, or correct
8. Prompt user to guess again if not correct
9. repeat until user is correct.



What has happened:
8/29/2025 4:07pm - Wrote a program to simply generate and print the random number-

&nbsp;			and learned that printf required formatting: "%d\\n", in order for the variable to display.






Expected Output:
