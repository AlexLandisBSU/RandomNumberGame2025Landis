# RandomNumberGame2025Landis

Current: (guessing before greeting)
1. Add include (stdio, stdlib, time) -> (because I forget this too often)
2. begin main as an int
3. add int placeholders/variables for user guess, the correct answer, and number of attempts.
4. generate a random seed with srand
5. generate a random number 1-100
6. 



What has happened:
8/29/2025 4:07pm - Wrote a program to simply generate and print the random number-

&nbsp;			and learned that printf required formatting: "%d\\n", in order for the variable to display.

8/29/2025 4:24pm - Got a while-loop working but kept forgetting formating such as above-
				also learned that the 1-100 might only be reaching 99, might have to add 1 to it during generation

8/29/2025 4:39pm - Attempted to add name and struggled with formatting to put user's name between two texts.
					- 4:43pm Forgot \n and the first guess jammed with the next line. (fixed).

8/29/2025 4:49pm - Fiddled with formatting and words to get what should be the final game for now. :D I HATE C FORMATTING
					- 4:52pm nevermind, forgot \n for the 50th time.
